 /*\title Example of EVADC Master Slave configuration for synchronous sampling of slave channels with master channel
 * \abstract Example of EVADC Master Slave configuration for synchronous sampling of slave channels with master channel
 * \description To whom this example is useful?
 *              When multiple ADC inputs are to be sampled simultaneously, then normally the same trigger signal is used. It is possible that such trigger signal is not connected to all EVADC queues. This example is useful for such use-cases, where some of the EVADC queues are not connected to the same HW trigger.
 *              With this example, three EVADC channels sample the analog input synchronously at the same time. Here the different groups are configured with master slave configuration, where only the master is triggered by GTM output.
