 /*\title This code example generates a periodic interrupt using the SCR RTC Module.
 * \abstract This code example generates a periodic interrupt using the SCR RTC Module.
 * \description This is a simple SCR (Standby Controller) example code using LED1 on the TC375 lite Kit to show a successfully working code. The SCR RTC (Real-Time Clock) module is used to generate a periodic interrupt to toggle the port SCR_P00.4 (P33.4) output. The TriCore(TM) CPU is used to mirror the port line P33.4 to P00.5 which has LED1 connected on the TC375 lite Kit.
