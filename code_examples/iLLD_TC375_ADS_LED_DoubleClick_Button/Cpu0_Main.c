 /*\title Control 2 leds with one button.
 * \abstract LED1 and LED2 are controlled by a single button. A single click toggles the state of LED1, a double click toggles the state of LED2.
 * \description The state of LED1 and LED2 is controlled by one button, so it is necessary to be able to detect when it is pressed once or twice.  
 *              When the button is pressed, a 300ms timer starts to detect the double click.  
 *              When the timer has expired, the state of the corresponding LED will changes according to the number of times the button has been pressed.
