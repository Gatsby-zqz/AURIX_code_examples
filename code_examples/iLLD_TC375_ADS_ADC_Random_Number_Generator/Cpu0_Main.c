 /*\title Create a random number in the 0 to 255 range using the ADC readings as generator
 * \abstract Create a random number in the 0 to 255 range using the Enhanced Delta-Sigma Analog to Digital Converter (EDSADC) readings as generator
 * \description The Enhanced Delta-Sigma Analog to Digital Converter (EDSADC) is used to read a value on channel 3, connected to port pin AN0.
 *              The ASCLIN module is configured for UART communication. The Shell from Infineon low level drivers (iLLDs) exploits the Asynchronous/Synchronous Interface (ASCLIN) module to interpret and manage commands from the user like "info", "random" and "help"
 *              which have been developed and are easily expandable. Random command returns a random number between 0 and 255.
 *              Using the EDSADC to select the less significant bit of 8 consecutive readings of the analog channel separated by a predefined wait time helps impoving the quality of the random number. The user restrict the range by predefining the value of n (e.g. random 10 will provide a random number between 0 and 10).
