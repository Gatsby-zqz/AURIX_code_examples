 /*\title Compute the FFT transform on a buffer of ADC readings
 * \abstract CPU0 sets the analog input channel and reads the output of a microphone using CCU6 generated interrupts. Once the buffer is filled CPU1 computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
 * \description This code example explains how to connect a microphone type KY-038 to the evaluation board, to collect analog sample and to apply a FFT to the data collected.
 *              The microphone type KY-038 is connected to the board with GND, 3.3 V and Analog Out pins.
 *              Capture/Compare Unit 6 (CCU6) is used to generate a timed interrupt.
 *              The Enhanced Versatile Analog-to-Digital Converter (EVADC) group 0 is used to read a value on channel 1. This channel is connected to port pin AN1. The reading is performed by the interrupt routine triggered by CCU6.
 *              Each analog reading is stored in a buffer, once it is filled, a flag is set and the FFT is performed.
