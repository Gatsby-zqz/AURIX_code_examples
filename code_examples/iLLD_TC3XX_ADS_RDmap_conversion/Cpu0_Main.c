 /*\title RD-Map to radar target range and velocity conversion
 * \abstract This example shows how to combine two radar detection bitmaps and how to convert the index of a radar target in the range-doppler map to target distance and velocity.
 * \description Two pre-computed detection bitmaps (results of local maximum searches of a NCI range-doppler map in range and doppler dimension) are combined bitwise and the range and velocity of the detected targets are calculated and stored.
